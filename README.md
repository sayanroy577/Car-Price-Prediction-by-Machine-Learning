# Car-Price-Prediction

The Jupyter Notebook 1_Car_Price_Prediction.ipynb from the GitHub repository implements a machine learning project for car price prediction. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model training using algorithms like Linear Regression. It evaluates models based on metrics such as  R-squared. The notebook aims to predict car prices based on various features like mileage, brand, and year.
